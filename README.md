<!-- TODO: versÃ£o [pt] (https://github.com/Deudz/dotfiles/blob/main/README-pt.md) -->

* what is a dotfile?

dotfiles are files/directories which start with a dot (hence the name dotfiles), they are hidden and usually contain configurations or cache <br>
they are found in your home directory, an example would be the `.bashrc` file

* how do i show them?

if you are on a terminal, the just type `ls -a` to see them<br>
but if you are on a gui file explorer like dolphin or nautilus, you usually press `CTRL + h` to show them

* i want to configure [program], where can i find/create its dotfiles?

you either find/create it in your home directory or in a directory called `.config`

TIP: if you are creating a dotfile to configure a program, create it in .config and create a directory in there called the same name as the program you're configuring <!-- hope that makes sense -->

* why use dotfiles?

to configure and customize your stuff!
